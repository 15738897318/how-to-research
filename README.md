## General Suggestion
#### [A student’s guide to undergraduate research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00871-x)
> 1. Choose the right lab
>> + Learn to think like a scientist.
>> + Look for questions, not subjects.
>> + Mentoring is as important as research.
>> + Reach out with confidence.
> 2. Get the most out of the experience
>> + Start your research with reading, and keep on reading.
>> + Set specific goals for yourself and let your mentors know.

## Paper Writing
#### MIT Biological Engineering Communication Lab: How to go about writing a paper. *Comment: Highly Recommneded. Practical Formula with Annotated Examples*
    + [General Tips](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/general-tips/)
    + [Abstract](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-abstract/)
        > - General and Specific Background (~1 sentence each). Introduce the area of science that you will be speaking about and the state of knowledge in that area. Start broad in the general background, then narrow in on the relevant topic that will be pursued in the paper. If you use jargon, be sure to very briefly define it.
        > - Knowledge Gap (~1 sentence). Now that you’ve stated what is already known, state what is not known. What specific question is your work attempting to answer?
        > - “Here we show…” (~1 sentence). State your general experimental approach and the answer to the question which you just posed in the “Knowledge Gap” section.
        > - Experimental Approach & Results (~1-3 sentences). Provide a high-level description of your most important methods and results. How did you get to the conclusion that you stated in the “Here we show…” section?
        > - Implications (~1 sentence). Describe how your findings influence our understanding of the relevant field and/or their implications for future studies.
    + [Introduction](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-introduction/)
        > - General Background. Introduce the general area of science in which your project takes place, highlighting the status of our understanding of that system.
        > - Specific Background. Narrow down to the sub-area that your paper will be addressing, and again highlight the extent of our understanding in this sub-area.
        > - Knowledge Gap. After discussing what we know, articulate what we do not know, specifically focusing on the question that has motivated your work.
        > - “Here we show…” Very briefly summarize your methods and findings.
    + [Methods](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-methods/)
        > - State the reasons for choosing your methodology
        > - Use subheadings to organize content
        > - Provide minimal essential detail
        > - Avoid “we did…” or “the authors did…”
    + [Discussion](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-discussion/)
        > - Tell how your paper is special
        > - Relate your results to existing results
        > - Tell how your study’s limitations leave open the big questions
    + [Results](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-results/)
        > - Create a logical narrative, organized into subsections
        > - Each Results paragraph has rationale, data, and a transition
        > - Show minimal essential data
        > - Use appropriate style

#### Springer Nature Author tutorials: [Writing a journal manuscript](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/campaigns/writing-a-manuscript)
> By the end of the tutorial you should know on how to:
>> + Prepare prior to starting your research
>> + Structure your manuscript and what to include in each section
>> + Get the most out of your tables and figures so that they clearly represent your most important results.

#### [How To Write an Awesome Abstract](https://bitesizebio.com/13661/how-to-write-an-awesome-abstract/)
> + Background (2-3 sentences): Provide just enough background to “set the scene” – the bare minimum necessary to make what follows understandable.
> + Question (1 sentence): What was the goal of your study? State your hypothesis or question clearly and succinctly.
> + Results (4-5 sentences): I generally aim to sum up each figure or section of the paper in one sentence of the abstract.
> + Conclusions (1-2 sentences): Sum up very quickly why your results are important by tying them back in to the issue you mentioned in the introductory sentence.

## Computer Science Case
#### [INFORMS Journal on Data Science (IJDS) Editorial #1: What Is an IJDS Paper?](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/ijds.2020.003)
> An IJDS paper will have four ingredients, data + methodology + decisions + implications, but the key is the synthesis of the ingredients, anchored to methodology. Here is one potential approach for such synthesis that will be familiar to many in our community:
>> Fired by a managerial/industrial decision-making motivation and potential/actual impact, the paper introduces aninnovative data sciencemethodology (model/algorithm/ approach), applies it to data (real-world and/or simulated) to illustrate its usefulness and behavior, and considers practical (e.g., computation, implementation) and ethical (e.g., societal, environmental) implications.
