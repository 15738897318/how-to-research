# Research-related Resources
This is the repository for the collection of instrunctions about how to research.

## General Suggestion
* [A student’s guide to undergraduate research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00871-x)
> 1. Choose the right lab
>> + Learn to think like a scientist.
>> + Look for questions, not subjects.
>> + Mentoring is as important as research.
>> + Reach out with confidence.
> 2. Get the most out of the experience
>> + Start your research with reading, and keep on reading.
>> + Set specific goals for yourself and let your mentors know.
>> + Research takes time.
>> + Find a healthy balance.
>> + Find financial support.
>> + Always think about the big picture.

## Paper Writing
* Springer Nature Author tutorials: [Writing a journal manuscript](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/campaigns/writing-a-manuscript)
> By the end of the tutorial you should know on how to:
>> + Prepare prior to starting your research
>> + Structure your manuscript and what to include in each section
>> + Get the most out of your tables and figures so that they clearly represent your most important results.

* [How To Write an Awesome Abstract](https://bitesizebio.com/13661/how-to-write-an-awesome-abstract/)
> + Background (2-3 sentences): Provide just enough background to “set the scene” – the bare minimum necessary to make what follows understandable.
> + Question (1 sentence): What was the goal of your study? State your hypothesis or question clearly and succinctly.
> + Results (4-5 sentences): I generally aim to sum up each figure or section of the paper in one sentence of the abstract.
> + Conclusions (1-2 sentences): Sum up very quickly why your results are important by tying them back in to the issue you mentioned in the introductory sentence.

* [How to Write a Thoughtful Discussion for Your Scientific Paper](https://bitesizebio.com/31855/write-discussion-paper/)
> 1. Do Summarize Your Results and Outline Their Interpretation in Light of the Known Literature
> 2. Do Explain the Importance of Your Results
> 3. Do Acknowledge the Shortcomings of the Study
> 4. Do Discuss Any Future Directions
> 5. Don’t Reiterate Your Results
> 6. Don’t Over-Interpret Your Findings
> 7. Don’t Introduce a New Piece of Data
> 8. Don’t Use Too Much Jargon

## Computer Science Case
* [INFORMS Journal on Data Science (IJDS) Editorial #1: What Is an IJDS Paper?](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/ijds.2020.003)
> An IJDS paper will have four ingredients, data + methodology + decisions + implications, but the key is the synthesis of the ingredients, anchored to methodology. Here is one potential approach for such synthesis that will be familiar to many in our community:
>> Fired by a managerial/industrial decision-making motivation and potential/actual impact, the paper introduces aninnovative data sciencemethodology (model/algorithm/ approach), applies it to data (real-world and/or simulated) to illustrate its usefulness and behavior, and considers practical (e.g., computation, implementation) and ethical (e.g., societal, environmental) implications.
