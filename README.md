## Computer Science Case

> An IJDS paper will have four ingredients, data + methodology + decisions + implications, but the key is the synthesis of the ingredients, anchored to methodology. Here is one potential approach for such synthesis that will be familiar to many in our community:
>> Fired by a managerial/industrial decision-making motivation and potential/actual impact, the paper introduces aninnovative data sciencemethodology (model/algorithm/ approach), applies it to data (real-world and/or simulated) to illustrate its usefulness and behavior, and considers practical (e.g., computation, implementation) and ethical (e.g., societal, environmental) implications.
